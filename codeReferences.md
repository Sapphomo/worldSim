There's a lot of great ways to approach the project scripting / programming. Based off of some initial research, looking to utilize a combination of Python for main code and Lua for some scripting / table-within-table calls.

Lots of great projects started; however we don't need the multi-user functionality as it will be a single player terminal experience platform for plugging in stories.
